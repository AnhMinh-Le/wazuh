# API Reference

The Vulnerability Scanner module indexes package and operating system vulnerabilities data into a dedicated index within the Wazuh-indexer (OpenSearch). So the information can be retrieved by using the Opensearch API (ref: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/).

For a quick reference, the table below lists the component and its specific query.

| Component                    | Query                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Vulnerabilities              | GET /wazuh-states-vulnerabilities-*/_search |
